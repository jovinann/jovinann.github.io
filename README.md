### Movie Success Predictor
[Publication](https://github.com/jovinann/SC1015-Mini-Project-Movie-Success-Predictor/tree/main)
My project is about building a predictive model to determine a movie’s potential success using a range of movie characteristics. The goal is to create a comprehensive movie score predicting system that draws insights from real-world investment challenges. By analyzing film financial viability, the project aims to help investors make informed decisions on whether to invest in certain movies.
